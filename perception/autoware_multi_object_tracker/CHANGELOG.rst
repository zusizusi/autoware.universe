  * feat: add Odometry uncertainty to object tracking
  * feat: Add odometry heading uncertainty to object pose covariance
  feat: Rotate object pose covariance matrix to account for yaw uncertainty
  Rotate the object pose covariance matrix in the uncertainty_processor.cpp file to account for the yaw uncertainty. This ensures that the covariance matrix accurately represents the position uncertainty of the object.
  Refactor the code to rotate the covariance matrix using Eigen's Rotation2D class. The yaw uncertainty is added to the y-y element of the rotated covariance matrix. Finally, update the object_pose_cov array with the updated covariance values.
